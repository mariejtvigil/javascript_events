			<h1>My Man, Hamlet</h1>

		<p>&ldquo;To be, or not to be&hellip;&rdquo; is the opening phrase of a soliloquy in the &ldquo;Nunnery Scene&rdquo; of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s play Hamlet.
			In the speech, a despondent or feigning Prince Hamlet contemplates death and suicide. He bemoans the pains and unfairness of life but acknowledges the alternative might be still worse. The speech functions within the play to explain Hamlet&rsquo;s hesitation to directly and immediately avenge his father&rsquo;s murder on his uncle, stepfather, and new king Claudius. Claudius and his minister Polonius are preparing to eavesdrop on Hamlet's interaction with Ophelia.</p>
		<blockquote id="inputText">To be, or not to be- that is the question:
			Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
			The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
			Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
			And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
			No more; and by a sleep to say we end
			The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
			That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
			Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
			To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
			For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
			When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
			Must give us pause. There's the respect
			That makes calamity of so long life.
			For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
			Th' oppressor&rsquo;s wrong, the proud man&rsquo;s contumely,
			The pangs of despis&rsquo;d love, the law&rsquo;s delay,
			The insolence of office, and the spurns
			That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
			When he himself might his quietus make
			With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
			To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
			But that the dread of something after death-
			The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
			No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
			And makes us rather bear those ills we have
			Than fly to others that we know not of?
			Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
			And thus the native hue of resolution
			Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
			And enterprises of great pith and moment
			With this regard their currents turn awry
			And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
			The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
			Be all my sins rememb&rsquo;red.<br>
			<cite>Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1</cite>
